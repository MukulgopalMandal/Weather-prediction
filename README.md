 # Weather-prediction

This repository contains a project for Weather Prediction using machine learning techniques. The project includes Python code in a Google Colab Notebook to preprocess weather data, train predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization.

- Training machine learning models for weather prediction.

- Model evaluation and performance analysis.

- Visualization of predicted vs. actual weather data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- A Google account to access Google Colab.

- Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local system:

```Bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather- 
   prediction.git
   ```
2. Open the provided .ipynb file in Google Colab:

  - Upload the notebook to your Google Drive.

  - Open the notebook via Google Colab.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in a Colab cell:

```bash
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Upload or link your dataset in Colab and ensure it follows the expected format.
## Usage
