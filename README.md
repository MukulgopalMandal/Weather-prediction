 # Weather-prediction

This repository contains a project for Weather Prediction using machine learning techniques. The project includes Python code in a Google Colab Notebook to preprocess weather data, train predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization.

- Training machine learning models for weather prediction.

- Model evaluation and performance analysis.

- Visualization of predicted vs. actual weather data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- A Google account to access Google Colab.

- Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local system:
