 # Weather-prediction

This repository contains a project for Weather Prediction using machine learning techniques. The project includes Python code in a Google Colab Notebook to preprocess weather data, train predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization.

- Training machine learning models for weather prediction.

- Model evaluation and performance analysis.

- Visualization of predicted vs. actual weather data.
